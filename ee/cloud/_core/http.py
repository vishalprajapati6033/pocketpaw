"""HTTP-layer glue for ee/cloud — exception handler, registration helpers.

In Phase 0 the only function exposed is the `CloudError` → JSON-envelope
mapping that already lives inline at `ee/cloud/__init__.py:58`. We
extract it so it can be imported, unit-tested without booting the full
cloud app, and consistently registered.

Subsequent phases extend this module with: a request-id middleware that
propagates `RequestContext.request_id` from the response back to the
client (so frontends can echo it in bug reports), and any HTTP-shape
helpers that emerge during chat refactor.
