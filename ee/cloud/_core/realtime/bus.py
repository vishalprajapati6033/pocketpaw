# bus.py — EventBus protocol and InProcessBus implementation.
# Updated: 2026-04-30 — Added in-process subscriber API (Stage 1.B of
#   "Files as Knowledge"). publish() now fans out to local handlers as well
#   as WebSocket clients. Failures are isolated per-handler so one bad
#   listener can't block the rest of the dispatch.
"""EventBus protocol and in-process implementation.

Services call ``emit(event)`` (see ``emit.py``) which delegates to the active
bus. The default ``InProcessBus`` does two things:

  1. Resolves the audience via ``AudienceResolver`` and fans out through
     ``ConnectionManager.send_to_user`` (existing WebSocket path).
  2. Calls any in-process handlers registered via ``subscribe(event_type, h)``.

In-process handlers were added in Stage 1.B of the Files-as-Knowledge plan
so the upload pipeline can wire a ``FileReady`` listener without leaving
the bus singleton or pulling in an extra event runtime.

A future ``RedisBus`` (Task 33) will use the same protocol so call sites are
unaffected.
