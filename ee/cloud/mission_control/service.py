# ee/cloud/mission_control/service.py
# Created: 2026-05-13 (feat/mission-control-facade) — façade service that
# composes Instinct (Nudges + Pawprints) and the in-process activity buffer
# into Mission Control's unified WorkItem shape. PR 1 of three. The Tasks
# entity (PR 2) and Cycles entity (PR 3) plug into the same service surface
# without changing the wire contract.
"""Mission Control façade service.

Every function is module-level ``async def`` per ee/cloud rule #5. The
first line of each is ``body = <Request>.model_validate(body)`` (rule #6)
so callers from non-HTTP entry points (CLI, bus handlers, jobs) get the
same validation guarantees as HTTP routes.

Tenancy:
  - Service signature is ``(ctx, body)`` — the workspace lives on
    ``ctx.workspace_id``. We never accept ``workspace_id`` as a
    standalone arg (rule #5).
  - The instinct store is workspace-agnostic at its schema, but we filter
    via the pocket layer: a Nudge surfaces in Mission Control only if
    its pocket is visible to the caller's workspace. The pockets
    service's ``list_pockets`` already enforces this so we can rely on
    it as the chokepoint.

No Beanie writes here — the façade is read-only against Instinct + the
activity buffer in PR 1. Bulk-approve / bulk-reject delegate to
``ee.instinct.store`` (single ownership of the audit transaction lives
inside Instinct's store). Bulk-reassign / bulk-snooze raise 501 until
the Tasks entity (PR 2) lands the polymorphic assignee they need.
