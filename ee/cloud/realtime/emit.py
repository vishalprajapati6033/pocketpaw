"""Thin facade services call after successful mutations.

``emit`` never raises back to the caller. The underlying bus publishes
best-effort; a failure here must not abort the DB write that preceded it.
The one exception is if the bus has never been initialized — that's a
programmer error (probably forgot to call ``init_realtime`` in startup) and
surfaces as ``AssertionError`` so it's caught immediately in tests.
