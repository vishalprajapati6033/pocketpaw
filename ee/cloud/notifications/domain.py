"""Domain value objects for notifications.

Pure-Python frozen dataclasses. No Beanie, no Pydantic, no FastAPI
imports. The repository layer converts between these and the Beanie
``Notification`` document; the DTO layer converts these to Pydantic
response models.

Why a separate `Notification` from the Beanie document: services should
operate on plain Python values so they can be tested without a Mongo
fixture. The Beanie document carries persistence concerns (indexes,
ObjectId management, snake_case Mongo field aliases) that services
shouldn't touch.

`NotificationSource` is structurally identical to the Beanie sub-model
of the same name; the repository converts field-by-field. We accept the
duplication for now because eliminating it would require changes to
``models/notification.py`` and its callers — out of scope for Phase 2.
