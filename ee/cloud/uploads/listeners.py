# listeners.py — In-process subscribers for upload-related bus events.
# Created: 2026-04-30 — Stage 1.B of "Files as Knowledge". Wires FileReady
#   into the extraction chain and ingests the resulting text into the
#   workspace KB scope. Pocket-scope routing lands in Stage 3.E.
# Updated: 2026-04-30 evening — Stage 1.B follow-up. Remote storage
#   adapters (S3, GCS) don't expose a local path; the listener now streams
#   the blob into a NamedTemporaryFile via the adapter's async open() and
#   runs extraction on the temp file, cleaning up afterwards. Local-disk
#   adapters keep using the direct path with no extra I/O.
"""Upload bus subscribers.

The upload pipeline emits :class:`FileReady` on every successful upload.
This module subscribes that event and runs the indexing flow:

  1. Resolve a Path the extractor can read — either the adapter's local
     path (local-disk deployments) or a temp file streamed from the
     adapter's ``open()`` (S3, GCS, any remote adapter).
  2. Run the configured extraction chain to produce searchable text.
  3. Ingest the text into the kb-go scope ``workspace:{wid}``.
  4. Clean up the temp file on the way out, regardless of success.

Failures are isolated — a broken extraction or a missing kb binary must not
propagate back to the upload publisher. The bus already wraps each handler
in a try/except, but we keep the listener defensive so the failure mode is
"file uploads, but doesn't auto-index" rather than "upload aborts".

Pocket-scope routing arrives in Stage 3.E: the listener will check
``event.data.get("pocket_id")`` and route into ``pocket:{id}`` when set.
