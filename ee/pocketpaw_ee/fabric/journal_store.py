# ee/fabric/journal_store.py — Journal-backed write path for Fabric objects.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/fabric-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org Architecture RFC,
# Phase 3. Replaces the scope-filtering slice of #938, which had tried to bolt scope
# onto the legacy SQLite FabricStore and hit two blockers (schema migration; pagination
# leak). By writing to the org journal instead of a separate SQLite file, both blockers
# vanish by construction: the journal is append-only (no schema migrations), and the
# read path is a projection that applies scope filters BEFORE computing totals.
#
# This store is deliberately narrow — it handles object lifecycle only (create /
# update / archive / query). Object-type definitions and object-to-object links still
# live in the legacy ee/fabric/store.py::FabricStore. Those stay SQLite-backed until a
# follow-up slice; types are low-churn config rather than per-tenant data, and links
# need a richer projection model than one event fold. Callers can hold both: legacy
# FabricStore for schema + links, FabricJournalStore for objects + scope filtering.
#
# The store owns a FabricProjection instance — a read-through cache in front of the
# journal. Reads are served from the projection; writes go to the journal and the
# projection applies the event immediately so the next read sees the change without
# a full rebuild. On process start, bootstrap() replays from genesis to warm the
# projection; operators who persist a cursor can skip ahead.

    The store is event-sourced: every write becomes an EventEntry on the

    Writes also fold the emitted event into the projection so reads are
    consistent without waiting for a periodic rebuild.

    Typical wiring:
