# Fabric — lightweight ontology layer for Paw OS.
# Created: 2026-03-28 — Objects, links, properties in SQLite.
# Maps raw data into typed business objects with relationships
# so agents can reason across data.
#
# Updated: 2026-04-16 (feat/fabric-journal-projection) — exported the journal-backed
# slice (FabricJournalStore, FabricProjection, policy helpers, event payload types).
# The legacy SQLite FabricStore still ships here for types + links; object lifecycle
# + scope-filtered queries are the journal path. See ee/fabric/journal_store.py for
# the rationale (Wave 3 / Org Architecture RFC, Phase 3; supersedes #938).
