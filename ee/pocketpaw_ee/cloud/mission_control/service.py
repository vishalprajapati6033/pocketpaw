# ee/cloud/mission_control/service.py
# Created: 2026-05-13 (feat/mission-control-facade) — façade service that
# composes Instinct (Nudges + Pawprints) and the in-process activity buffer
# into Mission Control's unified WorkItem shape. PR 1 of three.
# Updated: 2026-05-13 (feat/mission-control-cleanup) — lifted the 501 stubs
# on bulk-reassign + bulk-snooze now that the Tasks entity (PR 2) is on
# ``ee``. Both endpoints delegate per-id to ``ee.cloud.tasks.service`` and
# skip non-Task ids (Instinct Actions don't reassign or snooze). Also
# tagged the per-bulk approve/reject loops with ``# no-event`` comments
# so rule #9 is satisfied without redundant double-emits.
# Updated: 2026-05-17 (feat/planner-gaps-and-deps) — pocketpaw#1118 P4
# threaded ``task.blocked_by`` through the WorkItem projection. Each
# dependency id is prefixed with ``task:`` so the frontend's heterogeneous
# feed can link dependency edges to their corresponding WorkItem rows
# without translating ids client-side.
# Updated: 2026-05-18 (feat/mc-plan-sessions-endpoint) — added
# ``agent_list_plan_sessions`` that delegates to
# ``planner.service.list_plan_sessions`` (the only module allowed to
# touch the PlanSession Beanie doc) and DTO-maps the typed summaries to
# the wire envelope. Status vocabulary mapping (ready/stale ↔
# draft/archived) lives here so the planner entity keeps its internal
# vocabulary while Mission Control surfaces the operator's terms.
# Updated: 2026-05-19 (feat/mc-create-cycle-endpoint) — added
# ``agent_create_cycle`` that backs POST /mission-control/cycles for the
# rail's "+ New cycle" button. Parses the wire's ISO strings, derives
# ``status`` from start/end relative to ``now`` (upcoming | active), and
# delegates the actual Beanie write to ``cycles.service.agent_create_cycle``
# — the single-owner rule (only ``ee.cloud.cycles.service`` may write to
# the Cycle Beanie doc) is enforced by an import-linter forbidden
# contract; the MC façade can never bypass it.
"""Mission Control façade service.

Every function is module-level ``async def`` per ee/cloud rule #5. The
first line of each is ``body = <Request>.model_validate(body)`` (rule #6)
so callers from non-HTTP entry points (CLI, bus handlers, jobs) get the
same validation guarantees as HTTP routes.

Tenancy:
  - Service signature is ``(ctx, body)`` — the workspace lives on
    ``ctx.workspace_id``. We never accept ``workspace_id`` as a
    standalone arg (rule #5).
  - The instinct store is workspace-agnostic at its schema, but we filter
    via the pocket layer: a Nudge surfaces in Mission Control only if
    its pocket is visible to the caller's workspace. The pockets
    service's ``list_pockets`` already enforces this so we can rely on
    it as the chokepoint.

No Beanie writes here — the façade is read-only against Instinct + the
activity buffer. Bulk-approve / bulk-reject delegate to
``ee.instinct.store`` (single ownership of the audit transaction lives
inside Instinct's store). Bulk-reassign / bulk-snooze fan out per-id to
``ee.cloud.tasks.service`` and report which ids weren't Tasks in
``skipped``.

Id conventions inherited from ``_action_to_work_item``: Instinct nudges
project as ``"nudge:<action_id>"``; Tasks project as ``"task:<task_id>"``
(via the Tasks entity's own projector). The bulk endpoints accept either
prefixed or bare ids — anything starting with ``nudge:`` (or any
non-Task prefix) is silently skipped by reassign/snooze because Instinct
Actions don't carry a polymorphic assignee or a due date.
