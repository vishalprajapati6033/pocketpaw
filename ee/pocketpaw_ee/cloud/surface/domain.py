# domain.py — Surface context value objects.
#
# Created: 2026-05-24 — Surface-aware chat preamble entity. The cloud
# chat agent today only sees scope / participants / current-pocket-id
# (three lines of dynamic context). Paw-enterprise is chat-first and
# every route will eventually have a chat bar — the agent should know
# which SURFACE the user is on and what's actually visible there. This
# module owns the value objects ``SurfaceKind`` (enumerates every chat-
# bearing surface), ``SurfaceMeta`` (client-supplied hints) and
# ``SurfaceContext`` (resolved snapshot + rendered preamble). Per the
# 11 entity rules, tenancy is enforced at construction — ``workspace_id``
# and ``user_id`` are required on ``SurfaceContext``.
