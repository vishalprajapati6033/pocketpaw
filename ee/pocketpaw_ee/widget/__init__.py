# ee/widget/__init__.py — Widget graduation + co-occurrence detection as
# a journal projection.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/widget-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org
# Architecture RFC, Phase 3. Supersedes the side-channel designs in held
# PRs #941 (widget graduation engine reading
# ``~/.pocketpaw/widget-interactions.jsonl``) and #942 (co-occurrence
# detector stacked on that same JSONL, shipped with a
# ``sorted(tokens[:6])`` bug that broke dedup for any query longer than
# six tokens). The org journal becomes the source of truth; the JSONL
# file is retired; and the ``sorted(tokens)[:6]`` fix ships with the
# projection itself — the signature is re-derived from widget pair on
# replay so out-of-band emitters with the old bug can't poison state.
#
# What we re-export: the store (write path), the projection (read
# path), the policy (graduation + co-occurrence decisions), plus the
# canonical action names and payload builders for out-of-band emitters.
