# ee/fleet/router.py — REST surface for the fleet install subsystem.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/fleet-rest-router) — Exposes the Python
# primitives shipped in the fleet installer + journal-emission patches so
# paw-enterprise's InstallFleetPanel can list bundled templates and
# trigger an install over HTTP. Matches the existing ee router pattern:
# internal ``prefix="/fleet"`` + registered via _EE_ROUTERS at
# ``/api/v1``, giving ``/api/v1/fleet/templates`` and
# ``/api/v1/fleet/install``.
#
# Updated: 2026-04-16 (feat/ee-journal-dep) — dropped the local
# ``~/.pocketpaw/journal/fleet.db`` in favour of the shared
# ``ee.journal_dep.get_journal`` FastAPI dependency. Now every ee/ route
# writes into the same org journal (SOUL_DATA_DIR or ~/.soul/), so the
# audit trail is no longer split across two SQLite files. The request
# body flag ``journal`` still defaults to True; setting it False opts
# out and passes ``None`` into ``install_fleet`` unchanged.
#
# Updated: 2026-04-19 (fix/fleet-install-auth-guard) — P0 security gap.
# ``POST /fleet/install`` used to take only a ``journal`` dependency, so
# any authenticated user (and in fact any caller the journal dep did not
# reject) could spawn agents + pockets into any workspace. The handler
# now requires ``current_active_user`` so unauthenticated callers get
# 401, and the target ``workspace_id`` must be carried in the request
# body so we can enforce that the caller is an ``owner`` or ``admin`` of
# that workspace. Enforcement uses ``check_workspace_action`` against the
# canonical ``fleet.install`` rule registered in
# ``pocketpaw.ee.guards.actions.ACTIONS`` — this piggybacks on the
# existing ``log_denial`` audit wiring so every 403 also lands in the
# audit log. Below-admin roles and non-members get 403.
# ``template_name`` / ``journal`` / ``actor`` stay exactly as before —
# the only shape change is a new required ``workspace_id`` field on
# ``InstallFleetRequest``.
