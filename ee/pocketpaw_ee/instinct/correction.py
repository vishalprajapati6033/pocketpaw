# ee/instinct/correction.py — Correction Loop data types.
# Created: 2026-04-12 (Move 1 PR-A) — Captures the diff between what the agent
# proposed and what the human approved so it can be used as a learning signal.
# Pairs with soul-protocol to form the correction loop: proposal → edit → soul
# remembers → next proposal improves.
