"""Pocket document model tests.

Uses ``Pocket.model_construct(...)`` rather than the normal constructor because
``Pocket`` is a Beanie Document — ``__init__`` requires collection
initialization, which isn't available in a unit test without a live MongoDB.
``model_construct`` bypasses validation, so these tests verify the default and
storage behavior of ``tool_specs``; schema-level validation of the field shape
is exercised at the integration layer in later tasks.
