"""Regression guard: the interaction prompt must keep its per-session
``__POCKET_ID__`` substitution in a trailing block, not embedded in the
bulk of the prompt.

Why this matters: DeepSeek V3+ and Anthropic prompt caching both work
on the longest common prefix. Every byte of dynamic content in the
middle of the prompt invalidates caching for everything after it.

A regression here is invisible at unit-test level (the prompt still
renders fine) but kills cache-hit rate in production, multiplying
input-token cost and latency 10x on warm turns.
