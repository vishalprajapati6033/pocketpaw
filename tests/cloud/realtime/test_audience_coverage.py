"""Coverage test: every Event subclass must resolve to a list without raising.

This catches a whole class of drift: add a new Event subclass, forget to add its
branch to AudienceResolver, and the coverage test fails. Room-scoped events
(typing.*) intentionally return [] — they're routed by ConnectionManager, not
the bus — so they pass too.
