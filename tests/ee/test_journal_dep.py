# tests/ee/test_journal_dep.py — Coverage for the shared ``get_journal``
# FastAPI dependency shipped in feat/ee-journal-dep.
# Created: 2026-04-16 — Pins three contracts the rest of ee/ depends on:
# the dep returns a real ``Journal`` instance, successive calls hit the
# cache (one Journal per process), and ``SOUL_DATA_DIR`` is honored as
# the override knob operators use to pin the data dir to a custom volume.
