"""Runtime discovery of extension implementations registered via entry-points.

Implementations declared under a ``pocketpaw.*`` entry-point group (see
`pocketpaw.extensions` for the group names) are loaded lazily on first
access and cached. An OSS install with no `pocketpaw_ee` package on disk
simply finds no entry-points and pays no import cost for cloud features.

Usage::

    from pocketpaw._registry import first, providers, has

    provider = first("pocketpaw.embeddings")
    embedder = provider.build_embedder(settings) if provider else None
