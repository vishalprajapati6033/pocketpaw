# ee/instinct/trace.py — Decision trace types for the Instinct pipeline.
# Created: 2026-04-13 (Move 2 PR-A) — Captures the reasoning inputs behind each
# proposed action so the audit log explains *why*, not just *what*. Paired with
# TraceCollector (the bus-subscriber context manager) and FabricObjectSnapshot
# (immutable rows that preserve referenced objects at decision time).
