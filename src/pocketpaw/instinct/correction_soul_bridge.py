# ee/instinct/correction_soul_bridge.py — Wires Corrections into soul-protocol.
# Created: 2026-04-12 (Move 1 PR-B) — Turns each captured human edit into a soul
# observation, and promotes repeated edits on the same field into a procedural
# memory. No new soul primitive — uses soul.observe() + soul.remember() as-is.

    """Connects captured Corrections to soul-protocol's learning hooks.

    Call `record(correction, action)` right after persisting the Correction
    in the store. The bridge:

    - Always observes the edit as an Interaction so it enters the soul's
      episodic tier with a recall-friendly summary.
    - Counts how many times the same `path` has been edited in this pocket.
      On the third match, synthesizes a short rule and stores it as a
      procedural memory (importance 7).

    The bridge degrades silently when the soul is not loaded — corrections
    still persist to SQLite, and the agent tool can still read them back.
    Nothing in the request path fails because soul is down.
