# Deep Work planner prompt templates.
# Created: 2026-02-12
# Updated: 2026-02-18 — Added GOAL_PARSE_PROMPT for structured goal analysis
#   (domain detection, complexity estimation, clarification questions).
# Updated: 2026-02-12 — Added RESEARCH_PROMPT_QUICK and RESEARCH_PROMPT_DEEP
#   for configurable research depth.
# Updated: 2026-05-21 (feat/taskspec-success-criteria) — TASK_BREAKDOWN_PROMPT
#   now instructs the planner to emit machine-verifiable success_criteria
#   and preconditions per task, with explicit discipline: criteria must be
#   objectively checkable (no "works as expected" / "should work
#   correctly"). Feeds the new first-class TaskSpec fields.
# Updated: 2026-05-21 (PR #1164 review) — TASK_BREAKDOWN_PROMPT JSON
#   example no longer says the description holds "acceptance criteria";
#   criteria belong in the dedicated success_criteria array.
#
# Prompt templates:
#   GOAL_PARSE_PROMPT — structured goal analysis (domain, complexity, roles)
#   RESEARCH_PROMPT — domain research (standard depth)
#   RESEARCH_PROMPT_QUICK — minimal research (skip web search)
#   RESEARCH_PROMPT_DEEP — thorough research (extensive web search)
#   PRD_PROMPT — PRD generation
#   TASK_BREAKDOWN_PROMPT — task decomposition to JSON
#   TEAM_ASSEMBLY_PROMPT — team recommendation to JSON

GOAL_PARSE_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert project analyst. Analyze the user's goal and produce a \
structured JSON assessment. This is the first step before planning — you need \
to understand WHAT the user wants, WHICH domain it falls into, HOW complex \
it is, and WHAT needs clarification.

USER INPUT:
{user_input}

Analyze the input and output ONLY a valid JSON object (no commentary). \
You may wrap it in ```json fences. The JSON must have exactly these fields:

{{
  "goal": "A clear, one-sentence restatement of the user's goal",
  "domain": "One of: code, business, creative, education, events, home, hybrid",
  "sub_domains": ["Array of specific sub-domains, e.g. 'web-development', 'react', 'aws'"],
  "complexity": "One of: S, M, L, XL",
  "estimated_phases": 1-10,
  "ai_capabilities": ["What AI can do for this project — be specific"],
  "human_requirements": ["What the human MUST do — things AI cannot"],
  "constraints_detected": ["Any budget, timeline, or technical constraints mentioned"],
  "clarifications_needed": ["Questions to ask BEFORE planning — only if truly ambiguous"],
  "suggested_research_depth": "One of: none, quick, standard, deep",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0
}}

DOMAIN DEFINITIONS:
- code: Software development, APIs, apps, websites, scripts, data pipelines
- business: Market research, business plans, accounting, legal, marketing strategy
- creative: Writing, design, music, video, art, content creation
- education: Learning plans, courses, study guides, skill development
- events: Weddings, conferences, parties, travel planning, logistics
- home: Renovation, moving, organization, DIY projects, gardening
- hybrid: Projects spanning multiple domains (set sub_domains to clarify)

COMPLEXITY RULES:
- S: Single deliverable, < 1 hour, no dependencies
- M: 2-5 tasks, 1-4 hours, minimal dependencies
- L: 5-15 tasks, days to weeks, multiple phases and dependencies
- XL: 15+ tasks, weeks to months, multiple phases, team needed

CLARIFICATION RULES:
- Only ask if the answer would CHANGE the plan significantly
- Maximum 4 clarification questions
- Skip clarifications for obvious or standard approaches
- Never ask about things you can reasonably assume

Keep confidence between 0.5 (very vague input) and 1.0 (crystal clear goal).

"""

TASK_BREAKDOWN_PROMPT = """\
You are a project architect. Break down the following project into atomic, \
executable tasks. Each task should have one clear deliverable.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
{project_description}

PRD:
{prd_content}

RESEARCH NOTES:
{research_notes}

RULES:
- Each task must be atomic (one clear deliverable)
- Mark tasks as "human" if they require physical actions, subjective decisions, \
or access to external systems that an AI agent cannot reach
- Mark tasks as "review" if they are quality gates or approval checkpoints
- All other tasks should be "agent"
- Ensure no cycles in blocked_by_keys (task A cannot depend on task B if B depends on A)
- Use short keys like "t1", "t2", etc.
- Keep estimated_minutes realistic (15-120 range for most tasks)

SUCCESS CRITERIA — every task MUST have a "success_criteria" array:
- Each entry is ONE concrete, objectively-verifiable statement that is true \
once the task is done. Someone who did not do the work must be able to check \
it without judgement calls.
- BANNED — never write vague criteria like "works as expected", "should work \
correctly", "is high quality", "looks good", or "is done properly". These \
cannot be verified and will be rejected.
- GOOD examples: "GET /health returns HTTP 200 with body {{\\"status\\":\\"ok\\"}}", \
"the invoice CSV has one row per overdue account", "pytest tests/ exits 0".
- Give 1-4 criteria per task — enough to confirm the deliverable, no filler.

PRECONDITIONS — every task MUST have a "preconditions" array:
- Each entry is ONE state/environment condition that must hold BEFORE the task \
can start, OR a condition under which the task should NOT run.
- These are conditions about the world — NOT dependencies on other tasks \
(those go in blocked_by_keys). Example preconditions: "a Postgres database \
is reachable", "the customer list has been uploaded to the workspace", \
"do not run if no invoices are overdue".
- Use an empty array [] when a task genuinely has no preconditions.

Output ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown code fences. No commentary. \
Just the raw JSON array:

[
  {{
    "key": "t1",
    "title": "...",
    "description": "freeform context and approach for this task",
    "task_type": "agent",
    "priority": "medium",
    "tags": ["..."],
    "estimated_minutes": 30,
    "required_specialties": ["..."],
    "blocked_by_keys": [],
    "success_criteria": ["concrete verifiable statement", "..."],
    "preconditions": ["concrete state condition", "..."]
  }}
]
"""

TEAM_ASSEMBLY_PROMPT = """\
You are a team architect. Given the following task breakdown, recommend the \
minimal set of AI agents needed to execute this project efficiently. Each agent \
should cover one or more specialties required by the tasks.

TASKS:

RULES:
- Recommend the fewest agents that cover all required_specialties
- Each agent should have a clear, non-overlapping role
- Use "{agent_backend}" as the backend for all agents
- Agent names should be lowercase-hyphenated (e.g. "backend-dev", "qa-engineer")
