# Deep Work Session — project lifecycle orchestrator.
# Created: 2026-02-12
# Updated: 2026-05-21 (feat/deep-work-intake) — issue #1161: added the
#   optional interactive intake mode. start_with_intake() runs GoalIntake's
#   clarification loop before planning so a vague goal becomes well-formed.
#   The one-shot start() path is untouched — a good goal still skips
#   straight to GoalParser. _materialize_tasks now carries success_criteria
#   and preconditions from TaskSpec onto each MC Task's metadata so the
#   outcome-verification sibling (issue #1162) can check them later.
# Updated: 2026-02-26 — Deep Work v2: Added cancel() method for project cancellation.
#   _materialize_tasks now copies max_retries and timeout_minutes from TaskSpec to Task.
#   New broadcast: dw_project_cancelled. Cancel stops all running tasks and skips pending.
# Updated: 2026-02-18 — Integrated GoalParser as first step in planning pipeline.
# Updated: 2026-02-17 — Record planning errors to health engine ErrorStore.
# Updated: 2026-02-12 — Added executor integration for pause/stop.
#
# Ties together GoalParser, GoalIntake, Planner, DependencyScheduler,
# MCTaskExecutor, and HumanTaskRouter into a single class that manages a
# Deep Work project from user input through goal analysis, optional
# clarification intake, planning, approval, execution, and completion.
#
# Public API:
#   session.start(user_input) -> Project   (create + plan + await approval)
#   session.start_with_intake(user_input, answer_provider) -> Project
#       (run clarification loop, then plan with the enriched goal)
#   session.approve(project_id) -> Project (kick off ready tasks)
#   session.pause(project_id) -> Project   (stop running tasks)
#   session.resume(project_id) -> Project  (resume dispatching)
#   session.cancel(project_id) -> Project  (stop everything, mark cancelled)
