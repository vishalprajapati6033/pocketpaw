# Paw Print — embeddable customer-facing widget layer for Paw OS.
# Created: 2026-04-13 (Move 3 PR-A) — The full-stack decision loop Palantir
# cannot offer: customer interactions on a Paw Print widget flow back into
# a Pocket in real time, Instinct nudges the owner, approved actions feed
# back to the widget. This module is the backend side of that loop.
