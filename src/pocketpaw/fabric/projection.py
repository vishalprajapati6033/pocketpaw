# ee/fabric/projection.py — In-memory projection over Fabric journal events.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/fabric-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org Architecture RFC,
# Phase 3. The projection is the read path: it replays `fabric.object.*` events off
# the org journal to reconstruct current-object state in memory, then serves queries
# against that state with scope filtering applied BEFORE the total count is computed.
#
# That last sentence is load-bearing. #938 attempted scope filtering in a SQLite
# FabricStore and ran into the pagination leak: `total` was computed pre-filter,
# `objects` was returned post-filter, so a caller could detect "hidden" objects exist
# by spotting a mismatch. Doing the filter in the projection means `total` is always
# derived from the filtered set — no pre-filter count is ever exposed.
#
# This projection is intentionally tiny:
#   - rebuild(journal, since_seq=0): replay events, build the state dict
#   - apply(entry): incremental single-event update
#   - query(...): return a FabricQueryResult scoped to the caller
# No persistence layer, no caching beyond the in-memory dict. Reopen a journal,
# rebuild(), and you're back in sync — same guarantee as a good CQRS read model.
