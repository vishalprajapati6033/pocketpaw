# ee/widget/events.py — Canonical event payloads for the widget journal projection.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/widget-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org
# Architecture RFC, Phase 3. Carries the intent of held PRs #941 (widget
# graduation engine reading a JSONL interaction log) and #942 (co-occurrence
# detector stacked on that log) onto the org journal. Both shipped as
# side-channel files at ``~/.pocketpaw/widget-interactions.jsonl``; this
# module retires the file and re-lands the same domain as a projection
# over three new action names:
#
#   - ``widget.interaction.recorded`` — one per user touch on a widget
#     (open / edit / click / dismiss / remove). Supersedes #941's
#     WidgetInteraction JSONL append.
#   - ``widget.graduated`` — one per pin / fade / archive decision the
#     policy fires. Supersedes #941's WidgetDecision apply path.
#   - ``widget.cooccurrence.detected`` — one per co-occurring-pair
#     signature that crossed threshold. Supersedes #942's PatternMatch
#     output. Critically: the signature on this payload uses
#     ``sorted(tokens)[:6]`` (sort FIRST, then truncate) — #942 shipped
#     ``sorted(tokens[:6])`` which truncates before sorting and breaks
#     dedup correctness across any query longer than 6 tokens. See
#     cooccurrence_signature below.
#
# Updated: 2026-04-19 (Cluster B Sub-PR #2) — added two new action names
# for the SuggestedWidgetsFeed accept/dismiss writers:
#
#   - ``widget.cooccurrence.accepted`` — operator accepted the pairing
#     suggestion. The projection treats this as a strong positive signal
#     for the pair (promotes it on the graduation curve).
#   - ``widget.cooccurrence.dismissed`` — operator dismissed the pairing.
#     The projection suppresses the signature on subsequent reads so the
#     feed doesn't re-surface a rejected pair.
#
# These are separate from the existing ``widget.interaction.recorded``
# action so the read-side (GET /widgets/cooccurrence) can filter purely
# on cooccurrence-lifecycle events without walking the entire interaction
# stream.
#
# Action namespace extensions are allowed per soul-protocol's v0.3.1
# catalog policy (custom namespaces are permitted for domain extensions
# that don't conflict with reserved prefixes). Pinned as constants so the
# projection + policy + store + tests all reach them through one import.
#
# Scope lives on ``EventEntry.scope`` (the journal column), never inside
# the payload. Same rule as ee/fabric/events.py and ee/retrieval/events.py
# — scope is the journal's canonical filter and duplicating it invites
# drift.

    ``sorted(tokens[:6])`` truncated before sorting, which meant any
    query longer than 6 tokens produced a signature whose sort order
    depended on which 6 raw tokens happened to survive the slice.
    The dedup guarantee the PR advertised ("word-order variants
    collapse") fell apart for longer queries:
    ``"d c b a e f g"`` and ``"a b c d e f g"`` both tokenise to the
    same bag but ``sorted(tokens[:6])`` produced
    ``['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']`` and
    ``['b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`` — two different signatures for
    the same semantic query.

    Fix: sort the full token list first, THEN slice — the resulting
    prefix is stable across rotations of the input tokens, so dedup
    works as the PR claimed.
