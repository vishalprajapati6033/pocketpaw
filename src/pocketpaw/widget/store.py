# ee/widget/store.py — Journal-backed write path for widget events.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/widget-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org
# Architecture RFC, Phase 3. Replaces the JSONL sink from held PR #941
# (``~/.pocketpaw/widget-interactions.jsonl`` behind an asyncio.Lock)
# and the apply side of both #941's graduation policy and #942's
# co-occurrence detector. Everything lands on the org journal now —
# one append-only event log, write serialisation inherited from
# SQLite WAL + transaction semantics rather than a per-process
# asyncio lock that didn't protect across multiple processes anyway.
# Updated: 2026-04-16 (feat/widget-track-endpoint) — Added
# ``log_widget_interaction_with_seq`` helper that returns the
# ``(EventEntry, seq)`` pair atomically. The POST /widgets/track writer
# endpoint needs the seq on its ack so the UI can round-trip to the
# journal cursor without a second lookup. The backend's
# ``SQLiteJournalBackend.append`` already returns the assigned seq;
# ``Journal.append`` drops it. Going through the backend here keeps the
# write serialised by BEGIN IMMEDIATE so there is no race between the
# INSERT and the seq read — which ``Journal.last_entry`` would have.
#
# Same store-as-thin-facade shape as ee/retrieval/store.py:
#   - ``log_widget_interaction`` emits ``widget.interaction.recorded``
#   - ``log_widget_interaction_with_seq`` same, returns (entry, seq)
#   - ``log_widget_graduation`` emits ``widget.graduated``
#   - ``log_cooccurrence`` emits ``widget.cooccurrence.detected``
#   - every emit is folded into the shared WidgetProjection so reads
#     are consistent without waiting for a rebuild
#
# Policy (thresholds, decision rules) and router (REST surface) live
# in policy.py / router.py so this module stays free of HTTP + UI
# concerns.
