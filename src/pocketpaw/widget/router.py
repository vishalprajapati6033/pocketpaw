# ee/widget/router.py — REST surface for the widget journal projection.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/widget-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org
# Architecture RFC, Phase 3. Carries the read-side intent of held PRs
# #941 (graduation state per widget) and #942 (co-occurrence
# suggestions) onto the journal-backed projection.
# Updated: 2026-04-16 (feat/widget-track-endpoint) — Added the writer
# endpoint POST /widgets/track. The paw-enterprise SuggestedWidgetsFeed
# (issue #74) has been POSTing to this route since it shipped; before
# this change the endpoint 404'd and every widget interaction dropped
# on the floor. The writer validates the UI's payload shape, emits
# ``widget.interaction.recorded`` onto the org journal via
# ``WidgetJournalStore.log_widget_interaction_with_seq``, and returns
# the journal seq on its ack so UIs can pin a cursor without a second
# lookup. Scope falls back to ``["org:*"]`` when the actor carries no
# ``scope_context`` — the UI's anonymous-session path passes an empty
# list.
# Updated: 2026-04-19 (Cluster B Sub-PR #2) — Added the write-side for
# the existing /widgets/cooccurrence read endpoint. Two new routes:
#
#   - POST /widgets/cooccurrence/accept  — operator accepted a suggested
#     widget pairing. Emits ``widget.cooccurrence.accepted``.
#   - POST /widgets/cooccurrence/dismiss — operator dismissed a suggested
#     pairing. Emits ``widget.cooccurrence.dismissed``.
#
# Both are thin writers that journal one event and return the same ack
# shape as POST /widgets/track. The SuggestedWidgetsFeed in paw-enterprise
# has shipped the accept/dismiss buttons since PR #74 but they were
# client-local only; with these endpoints the decisions now persist.
#
# Reads hit the in-memory projection; writes happen via
# WidgetJournalStore from pocketpaw callsites (this endpoint, the
# scheduled graduation scan). The dashboard still posts from the UI,
# it just now lands on a real route instead of 404ing silently.
#
# Store cache follows the same pattern as ee/retrieval/router.py: one
# warmed store per Journal id, bootstrap on first request, incremental
# apply on every subsequent write.
