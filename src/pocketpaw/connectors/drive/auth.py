# Drive OAuth helpers — bearer-token resolution for the connector layer.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (Workstream C2 of the Org Architecture RFC).
#
# The retrieval router hands the adapter a ``Credential`` from the broker at
# dispatch time. In production that credential's ``token`` is the bearer
# string we send upstream. For local development and tool-path invocations
# (the non-zero-copy builtin tools) we still need a way to materialise a
# token: the fall-backs live here so ``source.py`` stays focused.
#
# Precedence order (first non-empty wins):
#   1. ``Credential.token`` from the broker (zero-copy federation).
#   2. ``GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN`` env var (local dev / CI).
#   3. ``pocketpaw.clients.oauth.OAuthManager`` (existing token store
#      populated by the OAuth flow in the dashboard).
#
# TODO(hardening): we inherit ``OAuthManager``'s current contract, which
# refreshes lazily on access. For long-running dispatches we may want a
# warm-up phase so the first parallel worker doesn't pay the refresh
# latency for the whole batch. Deferred until the second concrete adapter
# (Salesforce) confirms the pattern.
