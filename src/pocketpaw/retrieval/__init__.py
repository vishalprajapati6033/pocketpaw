# ee/retrieval/__init__.py — Retrieval log + graduation as a journal projection.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/retrieval-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org
# Architecture RFC, Phase 3. Supersedes the side-channel design in held PRs
# #936 (JSONL retrieval sink) and #937 (graduation policy over that JSONL).
# Both targeted the same problem — an observable retrieval trail + access-
# count graduation — with a separate `~/.pocketpaw/retrieval.jsonl` file
# and its own mutex. The org journal is now the source of truth, so the
# JSONL sink is retired and the domain logic re-lands here as a projection
# over the journal's ``retrieval.query`` + ``graduation.applied`` events.
#
# What we re-export: the store (write path), the projection (read path),
# the policy (graduation decisions), plus the canonical action names and
# payload builders for callers that want to emit events out of band.
