# ee/retrieval/store.py — Journal-backed write path for retrieval + graduation.
# Created: 2026-04-16 (feat/retrieval-journal-projection) — Wave 3 / Org
# Architecture RFC, Phase 3. Replaces the JSONL sink from #936 (file at
# ``~/.pocketpaw/retrieval.jsonl`` with an asyncio.Lock around writes) and
# the apply-side of #937's graduation policy (which wrote decisions into
# the same JSONL). Both land on the org journal now — one append-only log
# instead of a side-channel file, and write serialization is inherited
# from SQLite's WAL + transaction semantics rather than from a per-
# process asyncio lock that didn't protect against multi-process anyway.
#
# The store is small on purpose. It:
#   - emits ``retrieval.query`` events when a retrieval happens
#   - emits ``graduation.applied`` events when a graduation decision fires
#   - folds each emitted event into a shared RetrievalProjection so
#     reads are consistent without waiting for a rebuild
#
# Everything else (policy decisions, REST surface, soul mutations) lives
# in policy.py / router.py so the store has no dependencies on the UI
# layer or on soul-protocol beyond the journal primitive.
